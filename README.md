Problem Statement
Educational institutions often lack adequate menstrual hygiene infrastructure,
including stocked dispensers, clean restrooms, proper disposal bins, and supportive
policies. Students face discomfort and poor hygiene, while administrators lack
visibility into on-ground conditions and issues go unreported or unresolved. There is
currently no standardized or anonymous system to monitor, report, or improve
menstrual support facilities on campuses.

Objective
To build a digital system that enables students to anonymously report menstrual
facility issues and allows institutions to audit, monitor, and improve infrastructure in
real time. The system should bridge communication gaps and promote menstrual
dignity through actionable data.
